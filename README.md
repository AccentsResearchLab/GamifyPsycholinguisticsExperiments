The Gamify Psycholinguisics Experiment is a collaboration between Dr. Laura Spinu, professor of Phonetics and Psycholinguistics at Concordia University, Montreal, and iLanguage Lab, an Open Source Field Linguistics company in Montreal, Canada.

## How it works

The experiment is code that tries to "gamify" psycho linguistics experiments to get more participants, get participants to share the experiments to gather more data, and data which might be of a reasonable quality...
